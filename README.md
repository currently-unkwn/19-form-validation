# Brief

In this project, we're going to create a sign-up form with validation.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Users should be able to:

- When the user unfocuses a field, the form should perform a validation check
- All the fields are required
- Should enter a properly formatted email address
- The password and confirm password fields should match
- Clicking on the show / hide button on the password field should change the visibility of the password (simply change the input `type` from `password` to `text` or vice versa)

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework like [React](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/e5u4nz4nq7a0umqw04a8/p8hehqu9gen3pkhq/aHR0cHM6Ly9yZWFjdGpzLm9yZy8=), [Vue](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/e5u4nz4nq7a0umqw04a8/x0hph3un9m5r4rh5/aHR0cHM6Ly92dWVqcy5vcmcv), or [Svelte](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/e5u4nz4nq7a0umqw04a8/6qhehoupn4mk35uo/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdmVsdGUuZGV2Lw==). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
- Take a step back and try writing the HTML and CSS for this project yourself. Start with the provided Figma file. If you get stuck, consider purchasing the [Advent of CSS](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/e5u4nz4nq7a0umqw04a8/kkhmh2u86pkdoefl/aHR0cDovL2FkdmVudG9mY3NzLmNvbQ==) solutions, where Amy explains exactly how to build this.
- Place additional checks on the password to make sure that it is secure
- Check the email address against a predefined list of email addresses to make sure that there's not a duplicate email address.
